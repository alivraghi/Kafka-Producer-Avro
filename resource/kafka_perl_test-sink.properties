# A simple example that copies from a topic to a SQLite database.
# The first few settings are required for all connectors:
# a name, the connector class to run, and the maximum number of tasks to create:
name=kafka_perl_test-jdbc-sink
connector.class=io.confluent.connect.jdbc.JdbcSinkConnector
tasks.max=1

# The topics to consume from - required for sink connectors like this one
topics=kafka_perl_test

# Configuration specific to the JDBC sink connector.
# We want to connect to a SQLite database stored in the file test.db and auto-create tables.
